# Implementation Comparison of Image Interpolation

## Basic Image
Use the algorithm to create a dot picture before interpolation.

## BiLinear method
The BiLinear method is an interpolation method that expands the Linear method variables into two dimensions.

## BiCubic method
The BiCubic method is an interpolation method that extends the one-dimensional Cubic method.
